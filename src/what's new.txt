# Note:
_If you are experiencing slow-downs when you start up, a previous version may have created a race condition with the svchost wildcard rule (if you created one)._
To fix this, it is easiest to just reset the firewall. Close Minimal Firewall completely, then open up cmd as administrator. Then just type in: `netsh advfirewall reset`

That will reset your firewall rules to default, and you can build again. 

### UI
- Removed status bar. 

### Backend
- Faster startup. 
- Wildcard rules for shared Windows processes (like svchost.exe, dllhost.exe, etc.) are now much smarter. They will create a precise rule for the specific service that needs network access, rather than a broad rule for the entire host process.

### Bugs
- A critical bug has been fixed where an "Allow" wildcard rule for svchost.exe could cause hundreds of duplicate rules to be created in a race condition. See the note above. 
- A short debouncing period has been added when a wildcard match triggers rule creation to further protect against race conditions.
